        <p id='about'>My name is Viet. I am a student at University of Houston. I came to the U.S in Fall 2018 and I am always of being here excited because I learn somethings everyday.
            My dream is to become a programmer. I am very happy when you visit this wedsite. I believe this wedsite can help you how to learn how to do some codes, particularly in HTML and Javascript. </p>
